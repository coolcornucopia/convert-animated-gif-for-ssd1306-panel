# Convert animated gif & videos for ssd1306-like OLED panel :rainbow: :sparkles:
The goal of this github repo is to offer Python:snake: scripts for **converting animated gif, still pictures (gif, jpeg, png...) and videos (mp4, webm...) in the ssd1306-like OLED panel format, with an optional zlib compression**, reducing CPU and disk usage when using them. You will also find MicroPython :snake: examples for demonstrating on a "real case" how to use the converted images...

The ssd1306 OLED panel is pretty famous on Arduino/Nucleo-based electronic devices, like on the [AlphaBot2-Ar](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/AlphaBot2-Ar) from [Waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/). You can also find it on the [Mars rover - WB55 version](https://en.vittascience.com/shop/275/Robot-martien---version-Nucleo-WB55RG) from [vittascience](https://en.vittascience.com/).
